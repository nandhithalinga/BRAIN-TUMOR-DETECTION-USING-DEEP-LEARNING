# BRAIN-TUMOR-DETECTION-USING-DEEP-LEARNING
A cutting-edge approach for MRI image-based  brain tumor detection.
*This project uses ResUNET Architecture and transfer learning for detecting braitumor.
*To categorise MRI images, this provides implementations of deep learning model ResNet50.
## Dataset Used
* “Brain MRI segmentation” dataset is used from Kaggle which contains brain tumor images and 
their respective masks. There are 2118 photos for training, 907 photos for validation and 904 
photos for testing belonging to 2 classes. In order to increase the amount of data we performed 
data/image augmentation by using ImageDataGenerator.
